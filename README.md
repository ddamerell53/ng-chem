ng-chem
=======

The angular based front end for the ChemBio Hub platform.

This is an app based on ui-router, angular-schema-form handsontable and Bootstrap to allow scientists (and anyone else!) to add datasets to a Django-powered back end. More information about the project as a whole can be found at 

###Requirements

This app is designed to run with AngularJS v1.3

Use bower install and grunt serve to run the application. You will need the back end to be running separately either within a vagrant container or within a virtualenv on your machine.
