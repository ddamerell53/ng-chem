				<h2 class="blue" id="problem">What to do if you have a problem</h2>
				<p><strong class="nexa blue">If you encounter a problem with the ChemBio Hub platform, and this help document does not provide the answer please use the ChemBio Hub platform menu box to submit an issue - click the logo and select <em>Report an Issue</em> Alternatively please email ChemBio Hub - <a href="mailto:info@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk" role="button" class="btn btn-default"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span> info@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk</a>. Support is currently very limited so it may take some time for someone to contact you with an answer.</strong></p>


				<h2 class="blue" id="setup">Set up a new project</h2>
				<p>When you first log in to ChemBio Hub, you are shown a list of projects. If you're using the system for the first time, this may be an empty list, so you'll have to add a project. To do this, click the <strong class="blue nexa">Add Project</strong> button. You'll be shown a popup window where you can specify a title for your project, they type of project it is, whether you want it to start an incremental counter field and also project data fields.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/add-project.png"></p>

				

				<p>The project data fields are part of what makes ChemBio Hub so useful - these are columns in your data that you can make mandatory for people adding data, have text, numeric, multiple choice, tagging or even file attachment fields. Fill in the parts of the field as required. If you want to add more, click the <strong class="blue nexa">Add</strong> button. When you're done, click <strong class="blue nexa">Save Changes and Close</strong>.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/new-project.png"></p>

				<p>The page will reload and you'll see your new project at the top of the list.</p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="adding-users">Add users</h2>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/project-summary.png"></p>


				<p>Now you have your project set up how you want it, you are the project owner and can do things like add more fields, and change whether fields are mandatory. Another important thing you can do is to add users to your project. You can do this by clicking on the <strong class="blue nexa">Edit User Roles</strong> link on your project.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/user-roles.png"></p>

				<p>In the popup window, you can add users to your project with different roles - Owners, Editors, Viewers. Owners can edit everything about the project and add other users. Editors can edit and view data which has been added but nothing else. Viewers can only see the data for that project. Type the name of the user you want to assign a role to and click their name in the list.</p>

				<p>You can invite people to log into the system once you have added a project. Open the main menu button in the top right corner and click <strong class="blue nexa">Send an invitation.</strong></p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="adding-data">Put your data into a project</h2>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/project-summary.png"></p>


				<p>Once you've set up your project and users, you can start adding data either one item at a time or as a dataset in an Excel file. Chemical data can also be added via SDF files. If you need to know which project data fields are in your project, you can download a template file with the headers in. Choose your file and click <strong class="blue nexa">Upload</strong>.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/upload-data.png"></p>

				<p>When adding data to a project, your column headers in your file might not exactly match the ones in the project, or you might have extra fields that you want to also add or just ignore. If your data column can be "automapped" to a project column, it wil have a green label in the header. If a column has not been automapped, you can either upload it as it is and create a new column, or you can manually map it to a project column. To do this click the icon in the column header. You will see a list of available project fields to map to. Pick one from the list and it will show as a green mapped column in the table header.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/data-mapping.png"></p>

				<p>When you're done, click <strong class="blue nexa">Save these Records</strong>. You are then forwarded to the search page so that you can see your uploaded results. Data which has come from one file is given an upload ID so that you can see which records came from the same file later on.</p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="search">Search your data</h2>
				<p>Once you've added some data, you'll probably want to refer back to it at some point in the future! ChemBio Hub has a powerful search architecture. You can do simple text searches - start typing in the Search ChemBio Hub platform box.</p>

				<p>You can do more complex searches and filter by individual field. Click the button in the column header and chose the type of filter you want for that column. All column filters and sorts are shown in the boxes above the results table. Yo can remove a search filter by clicking the close x in the top right corner of each.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/search-filter.png"></p>

				<p>If you find you're doing a particular search over and over - for example "data added within the last two weeks" - you can save your search to re-run later. Open the <strong class="blue nexa">Saved search</strong> menu and click <strong class="blue nexa">Save this search</strong>. Give your search a title to refer to later and click <strong class="blue nexa">Save Changes and Close</strong>. To re-run your search, click My saved searches in the Saved search menu. You can run the search parameters again and get new results or you can re-run the search with the same results returned as it was when you saved that search and only see results from that time.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/saved-search.png"></p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="chem-search">Chemical searching</h2>
				<p>If your system is set up to hold chemical data and you have at least one chemical project set up, you can search for compounds based on chemical similarity. To launch the chemical search form, click the button in the Structure column header. This will show a chemical sketcher and a choice of Substructure and Exact Match searches.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/data-mapping.png"></p>

				<p>You can use the Saved Searches feature with chemical search to save repeatedly sketching the same molecule.</p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="edit-data">Edit your data</h2>
				<p></p>
				If you need to modify or add extra fields to your data, you can do so in a couple of ways:

				<ul>
					<li><em>Edit one record</em> - open the details popup window for that record by clicking the system ID number and then clicking Edit.</li>
					<li><em>Bulk edit multiple records</em> - you can do drag-to-fill editing for multiple records. Make sure the data to be edited is all in the same project and that project is selected in the search form. You should now see an Edit button link above the table - click it and you can now edit data directly within the table. When you're done, the data will be automatically saved. To make more changes, click Edit again.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="attachments">Attach extra files</h2>
				<p>One of the field types for the project fields that you set up at the start was File Upload. This means that you can attach extra files (like pictures, powerpoint files, PDFs and more) to a data record. Make sure one of your project fields is a File Upload field, go to the record you want to attach a file to and click Edit.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><img src="img img-responsive img-thumbnail" ng-src="images/help/add-attachments.png"></p>

				<p>Click the grey <strong class="blue nexa">+</strong> icon to chhose a file to add. It will be uploaded automatically. To remove a file, click the x in the top right corner of the thumbnail. When you're done, click <strong class="blue nexa">Update Project data</strong> to save your record.</p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="export-data">Export your data</h2>
				<p>If you want to export your data in an excel file, you can do so on the search page. Pick your search parameters and when you're ready, choose <strong class="blue nexa">Export all to Excel</strong> from the Export menu. If you have any Chemistry projects, you can also <strong class="blue nexa">Export all to SDF</strong>.</p>

				<p class="text-right"><a ng-click="scrollTo('top')">back to top</a></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="platemaps">Platemaps</h2>
				<p>You can set up projects which allow addition of <strong class="nexa">Platemaps</strong>. This means that you can create a grid of 48 or 96 wells (currently) and "assign" items from other projects to each well. To do this, from the project list page, click Add Project. Fill in the form as described in the <a href="#setup">Setup new project</a> section, ensuring you choose "Plate Map" as the project type. This will autocreate some default fields - please leave these as they are. When you have set up your project, Click the Add Plate link which is in the summary box.</p>
				
				<p>Fill in the form that is shown, and click Create New Plate. You will now see a plate grid displayed, with empty (white) wells - you're ready to start filling your plate.</p>

				<p>To add something, click the desired well and it will be highlighted with a red ring. A form is displayed next to the plate. Fill in the details you need to and click Save Well. The well will turn green to show that it contains data.</p>

				<p>When you have finished adding wells, click Save Plate. It will then show up in the Plate List, which is where the page forwards to the when you save a new plate. You can also access this list from the project summary or from the link at the top of the Add Plate page.</p>

				<p>You can add more data to a plate later - in the plate list, click the pencil icon in the Show Plate column. Add or change wells as you did before - after making changes, click Save Well and then Save Plate.</p>

				<p>You can fine tune your platemap list by either SGC Global ID or a general text search. Only plates which have a well containing the selected SGC Global ID will be shown, along with which well it's in. You can use the text search to look for anything else within your wells - barcodes, etc.</p>
