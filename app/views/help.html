				<h2 class="blue" id="problem">What to do if you have a problem</h2>
				<p><strong class="nexa blue">If you encounter a problem with anything to do with AssayReg, and this help document does not provide the answer you need, you can use the AssayReg menu box to submit an issue - click the AssayReg logo and select <strong>Report an Issue</strong> Alternatively please contact ChemBio Hub by email at <a href="mailto:info@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk">info@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk</a></strong></p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="loggingin">Logging in and initial screen</h2>
				<p>When you first successfully log onto AssayReg, you will see a list of available projects. A system administrator is responsible for adding you to projects, which will then be displayed in this list. If you think you should be able to access a project via this list and can't, please contact ChemBio Hub.</p>
				<p>Each project has a number of options available to you:
					<img src="images/help/project-list-item.png" class="img img-responsive center-block">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Project Overview</strong> - click the project title to be taken to the Project Overview page;</li>
						<li><strong>Add</strong> - Add data to the project via the Project Overview page, subject to the correct access permisions;</li>
						<li><strong>Search</strong> - Search data in the project via the search page - the project will be preselected, enabling you to filter results further.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="overview">Project Data Overview</h2>
				<p>For each project, there is a data overview page. This displays all of the data present in the project, separated out into three levels: <strong>Study</strong>, <strong>Assay</strong> and <strong>Activity</strong>.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" id="sections-explained">Project sections - an explanation</h3>
				<p>Each Project contains 3 sections:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Study</strong> - A study normally holds details for a collection of different assays, for example a set of different Characterisation experiments on a particular drug target.</li>
						<li><strong>Assay</strong> - An assay normally holds details of experimental protocols and method development, for example data which needs to be provided to make the assay reproducible. Assays can belong to multiple different studies.</li>
						<li><strong>Activity</strong> - An activity holds the outcome of one pass of an assay, usually machine readouts or more qualitative data. Activity data is specific to a given Assay.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3 class="blue" id="show-details">Show details</h3>
				<p>You can see the data for a particular level by clicking the appropriate Actions button and clicking View Details. This will open a popup window with the data loaded.</p>
				<p><img src="images/help/view-details.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"> <img src="images/help/details-modal.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>
				<p></p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Activity</h3>
				<p>Activity data for a particular assay is displayed as a table. You can page through the data easily using the buttons at the bottom of the table. If your table contains a lot of data, you can use the scrollbar at the bottom of the table to slide the table from side to side to see all the data.</p>
				<p>Each row of the Activities table contains a <strong>Duplicate</strong> link in the first column. Clicking this allows you to add a new Activity data point via the Add Single Activity form, with the data from this row prepopulated into the form. Adding Data is discussed in more depth below.</p>
				<p>If your Activity data contains a UOX ID as used in ChemReg, the system will attempt to load a structure image of that identifier into the table.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Filtering activities</h3>
				<p><img src="images/help/filter-and-download.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>
				<p></p> 
				<p>At the top of the Activities section, there is a text box which allows you to filter the Activities based on text entered here. So for example, if you type "dichloro" into the text box, the Activities table will only show rows that contain "dichloro" in any of the columns.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Export</h3>
				<p>Next to the text box on the activities table, there is a Download button. This allows you to download all the results in the table as an Excel file. The downloaded file will include any text filtering you have added - so if you have typed "dichloro" into the search box, your downloaded results will contain only results with "dichloro" in any of the fields. To download unfiltered results, just delete any text from the text box.</p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="adding-data">Adding data</h2>
				<p>If you have the correct permissions, you can add data to the system through the AssayReg user interface.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Single record</h3>
				<p>Adding a single record is the simplest means of getting data into the system. Click <strong>Add Single Activity</strong> and select the correct Assay template to use from the list shown.</p>
				<p>A form is then displayed with blank fields, each field has a brief explanation of what it represents. Specific datatypes may have special inputs - dates for example may show a datepicker/calendar field.</p>
				<p><img src="images/help/single-activity.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>
				<p>When you have added the necessary data, click the Submit button. Your data will be saved and you will be able to view it in the data overview page.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Multiple records (via upload)</h3>
				<p>To add multiple records to AssayReg in one go, you will need your data in an Excel format. You are able to download a template of the data format by clicking <strong>Upload Multiple Activities</strong> then click <strong>Download (activity) Template</strong> if you would like all of the fields which have been set up for the Assay listed. You can then use this to add your data for a smooth upload.</p>

				<p>If instead you have data within another spreadsheet, for example from another lab or from machine outputs, with extra fields that are not required for the Assay you're adding data to, you can also upload that data but you may need to map your data, which is explained later in this document. </p>

				<p>For simple file uploads, follow these steps:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Select the Sub-project and Assay you wish to register the data to. Select ‘Upload multiple activities’. Select the Assay definition you wish to submit your data to.<br>
							<p><img src="images/help/multiple-activities-1.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"><br></p>
						</li>	
						<li>
							Select the Assay definition you wish to submit your data to.<br>
						</li>	
						<li>
							A file upload dialog should now be shown. Click upload and choose your data file.<br>
							<p><img src="images/help/multiple-activities-2.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"><br></p>
						</li>	
						<li>
							If your file contains multiple tabs, select the appropriate one. The data will be previewed below.<br>
							<p><img src="images/help/multiple-activities-3.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"><br></p>
						</li>	
						<li>
							If there are no unmapped required fields for this upload, you can click ‘Save this sheet’. Your data is now registered to your project in AssayReg. <br>
							<p><img src="images/help/multiple-activities-4.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"><br></p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Data mapping</h3>
				<p>If you are uploading data for your Activities from a file containing lots of supplementary data, you may have to specify which columns in your file correspond to which Activity columns. This is especially important where there are <em>mandatory</em> fields for the specified Activity - that is to say, fields which cannot be empty for a single result.</p>

				<p>AssayReg uses data mapping to help with data integrity and also to allow conversion to formats required by public databases such as <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about.html" target="_blank">PubChem</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" target="_blank">ChEMBL</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Auto mapping</h3>
				<p>AssayReg will attempt to "automap" your columns to the Activity columns. Columns in your file which match columns in the Activity correctly have a green mapping icon <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-random text-success"></span> . Columns in your file which cannot be automapped have a yellow mapping icon <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-random text-warning"></span> .</p>

				<p>You may want to map a column in your file to an Activity column manually if the names are slightly different - for example, you may have a column called "1st Run" in your file and a column called "1st Observation" in the Activity table. They have the same meaning for your work but have been labelled differently. To do this, click the mapping icon in the column you want to map.<br>
					<!-- image -->
				</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Unmappable fields</h3>
				<p>Unmappable fields are caused by data fields in your file not matching the type expected by AssayReg for the Assay you are adding to. For example, you may be mapping your column containing text descriptions to a column expecting numerical values or dates.</p> 

				<p>Unmappable fields are shown in the mapping popup window for a particular column. You will see a message stating that there is a data type conflict, and the rows causing the issue (together with the row value) are displayed in a table.</p>
				<p><img src="images/help/unmappable-fields.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>

				<p>If this happens you should correct the data in your excel file, and try uploading again. If you believe your data to be in the correct format, you should speak to an AssayReg administrator.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Save</h3>
				<p>Once all of your fields are mapped, you are able to click <strong>Save This Sheet</strong>. Yor data will be saved, the Data Overview page will reload and you will be able to see your data.</p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="searching">Search page</h2>
				<p>AssayReg allows you to search for data across projects, studies and assays via the Search Page. You can also carry out text searches via the search bar at the top of every page (including this one).</p>

				<p>The search bar allows you to type text and matches for that text will be instantly displayed. If there are hits for the phrase within Assay, Study or Project titles, you can click those links and see data for that item in the search page.</p>

				<p><img src="images/help/searchbar.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>

				<p>You are also able to search for your text phrase easily on <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about.html" target="_blank">PubChem</a> - just click the link at the bottom, a new window or tab will open in your browser and you will see results for your search displayed on the PubChem website.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Filters</h3>
				<p>The Search Page allows you to filter the results shown in a number of ways. Whenever a filter is used, the results are updated automatically.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Dates</h3>
				<p>You can specify a date range for when records were added to the system - use the <strong>Activity Date From</strong> and <strong>Activity Date To</strong> datepicker widgets to specify your dates. Results are updated automatically.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >User</h3>
				<p>You can specify the user or users who uploaded the data you wish to see, based on your system permissions. Pick the names of users from the dropdown list, and they will be displayed as a tag list in the search box. You can remove any users you have selected. Results are updated automatically.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Project / Study / Assay filtering</h3>
				<p>You can specify the Project, Study or Assay the results belong to using the appropriate search fields. Pick the names of the project/study/assay you want to narrow results down by from the dropdown list, and they are displayed as a tag list in the search box. You can remove items as you need to. Results are updated automatically.</p>

				<h3 class="blue" >Text filtering</h3>
				<p>At the top of the Results table section, there is a text box which allows you to filter the Activities based on text entered here. So for example, if you type "dichloro" into the text box, the Activities table will only show rows that contain "dichloro" in any of the columns, in addition to any other filters you have applied via the search form.</p>

				<h2 class="blue" id="chembl">Depositing data to ChEMBL</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>AssayReg supports viewing your data in standardised format ready to be deposited to ChEMBL. To view data in a ChEMBL format, use the Search page to find your data.</li>
						<li>
							You are now in the AssayReg serach page. On the data record you wish to export, click ‘View as ChEMBL data’
							<p><img src="images/help/chembl-1.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Your activity data should now be visible as a JSON schema form. This is the format in which it will be deposited to ChEMBL - highlight the text, copy and paste into the ChEMBL submission form.
							<p><img src="images/help/chembl-2.png" class="img img-responsive center-block"></p>
						</li>
					</ul>
