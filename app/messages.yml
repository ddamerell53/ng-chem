    smiles_or_id_help_text: IDs can be any of the following formats: InCHI, InCHI key, SMILES, CAS numbers, Sigma aldrich catalogue numbers
    file_upload_help_text: Chemdraw XML or SD files only
    drawing_help_text: Draw the molecule you would like to register. If salts or hydrates are required, draw these as neutral molecules alongside
